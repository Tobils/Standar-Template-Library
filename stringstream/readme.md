# stringstream in C++ and its applications
A stringstream associates a string object with a stream allowing you to read from the string as if it were a stream (like cin).

Basic methods are –
```txt
clear() — to clear the stream
str() — to get and set string object whose content is present in stream.
operator << — add a string to the stringstream object.
operator >> — read something from the stringstream object,
```
