# NAME SPACE C++

 there cannot be two variables with the same name in the same scope. Using namespaces, we can create two variables or member functions having the same name.

 Classes are data types. They are an expanded concept of structures, they can contain data members, but they can also contain functions as members whereas a namespace is simply an abstract way of grouping items together. A namespace cannot be created as an object; think of it more as a naming convention. It is used as additional information to differentiate similar functions, classes, variables etc. with the same name available in different libraries. In essence, a namespace defines a scope.
